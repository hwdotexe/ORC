# ORC
_Online Roleplaying Compendium_ (Working Title)
  
Welcome to ORC - a personal project of mine to build a fast, simple, and useful tool for managing your tabletop roleplaying campaign. With ORC, you can keep your notes, characters, session logs, and encounters all in one place! Share notes with other players or with your Game Master, import extra details from your favorite game systems, and much more.
